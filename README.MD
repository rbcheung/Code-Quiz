# Coding-Quiz

## My Task
This project was created to allow me to practice my Javascript skills using functions, timers, localstorage and dynamically creating DOM elements etc. This website will present the user with a timed quiz about Javascript knowledge. This quiz is 75 seconds long and will subtract 10 seconds every time you guess wrong. If all questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0, the quiz will end. You get 1 point for each question right. once finished, users will have an option to store their score in localStorage. No changes to the HTML. All elements created dynamically.
